Credit Card Data Dashboard

This is a Credit Card Data Dashboard, which visualizes transaction data and provides insights into customer behaviors and credit card usage. 
Here's a breakdown of the key components:
  The "Blue," "Gold," "Silver," and "Platinum" buttons in the Credit Card Dashboard allow users to filter and view detailed transaction data specific to each card type,
  providing a focused analysis of spending patterns, usage behavior, and profitability for individual card categories.

  1. Card Categories
        The tabs at the top represent different card categories: Blue, Platinum, Gold, and Silver.
        You can filter the dashboard based on these categories to analyze transactions for a specific card type.
  2. Total Transaction Amount by Profession
        A treemap shows the distribution of total transaction amounts based on customer professions.
        Larger blocks indicate professions with higher transaction volumes, e.g., Businessmen, White-collar, etc.
  3. Total Transaction by Card Usage Type
        A pie chart breaks down transactions by the type of usage: Swipe (62.25%), Chip (31.75%), and Online (6%).
        This provides insights into how customers prefer to use their credit cards.
  4. Transaction Metrics
        Avg Transaction: Displays the average transaction amount (4.39K).
        Total Profit: Displays the total profit from transactions (244K).
  5. Total Transaction by Expense
        A bar chart categorizes transactions by spending types, such as Bills, Fuel, Entertainment, Food, Grocery, and Travel.
        Bills dominate the expenses at 2.7M, followed by fuel and other categories.
  6. Transaction Trend Over Time
        A line graph shows how the transaction amount fluctuates over time (days or months).
        Peaks and dips provide insights into high or low transaction periods (e.g., a peak at 931K and a dip at 785K).
  7. Total Transaction Amount vs. Volume
        A scatter plot shows the relationship between the Total Transaction Amount and Total Transaction Volume, segmented by card types (Blue, Gold, Platinum, Silver).
        This helps analyze spending patterns and the frequency of transactions.
Purpose of the Dashboard:
  To monitor customer spending behaviors.
  To identify which professions, expense categories, and card types drive revenue.
  To track trends and patterns in credit card transactions over time.

    
Customer Data Dashboard
    
Customer Data Dashboard focused on customer satisfaction ratings and their relationship with demographic, financial, and lifestyle factors.
Here's a detailed explanation of its components:

  1. Rating by Marital Status
      A pie chart showing how customer satisfaction ratings are distributed based on marital status:
        Married (50.71%) forms the largest group.
        Single (41.97%) is the second largest.
        Unknown (7.32%) represents a smaller fraction.
  2. Rating by Personal Loan
        This pie chart illustrates the proportion of satisfaction ratings between customers who:
        Do not have a personal loan (87.31%), which is the majority.
        Have a personal loan (12.69%).
  3. Rating by Car Owner
      Similar to the above, this pie chart divides ratings by whether the customer owns a car:
        Yes (59.79%): Car owners tend to have higher representation.
        No (40.21%).
  4. Rating of House Owner
        A bar chart visualizing customer satisfaction scores based on house ownership:
        Customers who own houses generally have higher satisfaction scores across the range.
  5. Income of Rating
        A line graph showing the relationship between income and satisfaction scores:
        Income peaks at satisfaction scores of 1 and 4 (above 58K).
        Lower scores (e.g., 3) correlate with slightly lower average income.
  6. State with High Rating
        A treemap highlighting states where customer satisfaction scores are higher:
        CA (California) has the largest segment.
        Other states include TX (Texas), NY (New York), and FL (Florida).
  7. Rating by Age
        A line graph illustrating how average customer age correlates with satisfaction scores:
        Age peaks around scores of 2 and 4 (~46.3 years).
  8. Rating by Job
        A horizontal bar chart showing satisfaction ratings distributed across professions:
        Self-employed individuals (8K) have the highest representation.
        Other professions include Businessmen (6K), Blue-collar (5K), and so on.
        Retirees (3K) have the smallest representation.
  9. Rating by Education
        A horizontal bar chart ranking satisfaction scores based on education level:
        Graduates (13K) have the highest count.
        Other categories include High School (7K), Post-Graduate (2K), and Doctorate (1K).
        Uneducated and Unknown are also included with lower counts.
  Purpose of the Dashboard:
      To analyze how customer satisfaction correlates with demographics (e.g., marital status, age, job, education) and lifestyle factors (e.g., car or house ownership).
      To identify trends in income and regional data (states) tied to satisfaction scores.
      Useful for strategizing customer retention and targeted marketing efforts.

Integration Between Dashboards
    Buttons for Navigation:
    "Transactional Data" Button: Clicking this switches to the Customer Data Dashboard.
    "Customer Data" Button: Clicking this switches back to the Credit Card Data Dashboard.
These buttons allow users to seamlessly toggle between transaction data and customer satisfaction insights.
    Connection Logic
    The two dashboards provide complementary insights:

Credit Card Data Dashboard (Transaction-focused):

  Highlights transaction details such as card usage types, professions, expense categories, and time trends.
  Offers a deeper understanding of customer spending behavior and profitability.
  Customer Data Dashboard (Customer-focused):

  Focuses on customer demographics, satisfaction scores, and their relationships with financial and lifestyle factors.
  Provides actionable insights into which customer groups (e.g., married, homeowners, or graduates) have higher satisfaction and income potential.
Example Use Case of Connected Dashboards:

A business user can start with the Credit Card Data Dashboard to:
    Identify high-value transactions or profitable categories.
    Narrow down on specific card types (e.g., Gold users).
By switching to the Customer Data Dashboard:
    The user can explore satisfaction trends and demographic data for the same group.
    For example, they can analyze whether Gold card users have higher satisfaction if they are graduates or homeowners.
Design Considerations for the Buttons:
    The buttons are likely placed at the top, clearly labeled (e.g., "Transactional Data" and "Customer Data").
    They ensure a smooth user experience by visually indicating which dashboard is active.
